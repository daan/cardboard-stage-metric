# cardboard-stage-metric

This repository contains a port of the [MtM configurable cardboard stage](http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/science/) made by MIT Center for Bits and Atoms by [James Coleman and Nadya Peek](http://archive.monograph.io/james/m-mtm). We use this version in the Digital Design Fabrication Course at Industrial Design KAIST.

The main file is a parametric Autocad drawing. We used Autocad  because it is able to create 2D drawings with multiple colors, which was essential for cutting cardboard. The Autocad file with parameters drives a 3D Inventor model.
